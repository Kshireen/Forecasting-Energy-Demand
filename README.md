# Energy Demand Forecasting 

This repository is dedicated to the Energy Demand Forecasting project, where we leverage the Prophet model to predict energy demand on an hourly basis. As a machine learning engineer and web developer, I've employed my expertise in data analytics, statistical modeling, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms to create an accurate and efficient forecasting system


## Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to forecast energy demand at an hourly granularity using the Prophet model. Accurate energy demand predictions are crucial for optimizing resource allocation, managing grid stability, and ensuring a reliable energy supply.


### Key Features

- **Prophet Model:** Implemented the Prophet time series forecasting model developed by Facebook Research. This model is designed to handle daily patterns, holidays, and special events, making it well-suited for our energy demand forecasting needs.
